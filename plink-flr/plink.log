Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
6000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
After filtering, 2687 cases, 3313 controls and 0 missing
